# Satellite To Aerial Imaginary

A Model that can classify various things from satellite images like rivers, buildings, mountains, etc... <br>

• And for a Better result, I have to use the **Semantic segmentation** Of the **U-Net model** for Classification.<br>
• Got the Best accuracy In U-Net Model.<br>
